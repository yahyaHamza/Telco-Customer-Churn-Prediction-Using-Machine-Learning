# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
  ## Overview
    This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service in the near future, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain these customers.
  ## Project Structure
    - **"Telco Customer Churn using ML.ipynb"**: The Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation of the project.
    - **"data/"**: Directory containing the dataset used for the project.
    - **"README.md"**: Project documentation.
  ## Tools and Technologies
    - **Programming Language**: Python
    - **Libraries**:
      - **"pandas"**: For data manipulation and analysis.
      - **"numpy"**: For numerical computations.
      - **"cufflinks"**, **"plotly"**,, and **"seaborn"**,: For data visualization.
      - **"scikit-learn"**,: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
  ## Dataset
    The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It includes various attributes of customers such as their demographics, account information, and services they have subscribed to.
  ## Methodology
    1. **Data Preprocessing**:
      - Handling missing values.
      - Handling outliers.
      - Normalizing and scaling numerical features.
      - Encoding categorical variables.
      - Applying dimensionality reduction.
    2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
      - Visualizing the distribution of features.
      - Identifying correlations between features and the target variable (churn).
    3. **Model Development**:
      - Splitting the data into training, validating, and testing sets.
      - Training various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
      - Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
    4. **Model Evaluation**:
      - Comparing the performance of different models.
      - Selecting the best model based on evaluation metrics.
  ## Results
    The project successfully identifies customers who are likely to churn with a high degree of accuracy. The best-performing model is [Bagging classifier from ensemble learning using Logistic Regression] , which achieved an accuracy of [82%] on the test set.
  
  ## Conclusion
    This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict customer churn, providing valuable insights for the telecommunications company to improve customer retention strategies. Future work may involve enhancing the model with additional features, performing hyperparameter tuning, and deploying the model in a production environment.
